This repo is a fork of [react-portfolio-template](https://github.com/aavondet/react-portfolio-template) by chetanverma16. I just aded a GitHub Actions workflow so that one can simply edit `src/yourdata.js` within the GitHub website and have the changes be deployed through GitHub Pages with no need to interact with a terminal or cloniong the repo.

## Sections
✔️ Header
✔️ Work
✔️ About
✔️ Skills
✔️ Contact

## How To Use 

1. Go to `/src/yourdata.js`
2. Make edits as you want
3. Commit changes and wait for the workflow to complete
4. View your deployment!

#### Personalize page content in `/src/yourdata.js` & modify it as per your need.

```javascript
/* Change this file to get your Personal Porfolio */
 // Edit Values of these variables

name:"Tartan",
headerTagline: [
    "My heart is in the",.... 
]

```

## Deployment
Make sure to commit your changes after editting `/src/yourdata.js`, then the updates should deploy in a couple of minutes via GitHub Actions.
